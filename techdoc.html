                CPU
            </header>
            <p>
                The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is essentially the brain of the computer. 
                The CPU's job is to execute instructions in the form of code. The CPU consists of an ALU, 
                or arithmic and logic unit, a control unit, and a varying number of registers. Modern
                CPU's use multiple cores designed to seperate tasks and thus run more efficiently. Thus, 
                more cores = more processing power. Generally Hexa Cores and higher are only used in 
                servers or quantum computers.

            <p>
                The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is what handles graphics. 
                Designed to rapidly manipulate memory to accelerate the pixelation of images to match target
                framerates, these are an important aspect of any computer built for gaming or utilizing
                HD multimedia.

                To check your PC's GPU open Command Prompt and type in <code> wmic path win32_VideoController get name</code>.

                Motherboard
            </header>
            <p>
                The Motherboard is the backbone of the PC, it is the framework that binds together most of the
                other elements of a computer. When you think of the inside of a computer, you probably think
                of a lot of chips and wires - this is the motherboard, connecting everything together. The 
                primary difference between types of motherboards is varying ports, both external and internal, 
                among other small variations.

                To see your motherboard specs, open Command Prompt and type in <code> wmic baseboard get product,Manufacturer</code>.

                Memory
            </header>
            <p>
                Your RAM, or random access memory, is your PC's short-term memory. It remembers and files 
                everything currently running on your computer. All data currently being accessed is 
                stored and organized in the RAM, so that your computer can run various operations or 
                files at the same time. The two primary variations in RAM types are DRAM, Dynamic RAM, and 
                SRAM, Static RAM. DRAM, given to small drains in information stored, has to be refreshed 
                every few milliseconds, thus making it slightly slower than SRAM.

                Hard Drive
            </header>
            <p>
                The Hard Drive is long-term memory. This is the physical space in which all your files are stored, 
                from pictures to music to games to movies, it all gets stored on the Hard Drive, which can be 
                accessed by your computer, or more specifically your OS, or Operations System, as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see details on your Hard Drive, open Command Prompt and type <code> wmic diskdrive</code> for general specs, or <code> wmic diskdrive get size</code> for size specifically.

                        <p>
                            Parallel ATA, a traditional and mechanical Hard Drive, rarely used in modern PC's.

                        <p>
                            Serial ATA, much like a PATA, except for differences in encoding and transportation, 
                            these are also mechanical Hard Drive's, and the default for most modern PC's.

                            Unlike the mechanical Hard Drives mentioned above, a Solid State Drive stores 
                            data on interconnected flash drives, as opposed to the various platters used on 
                            older HDD's, therefore making it able to transfer data significantly faster.

                Cooling System
            </header>
            <p>
                Your PC, or more specifically certain parts of your PC, get very hot while running.
                Specifically, your CPU and GPU (especially during intensive computing such as gaming) 
                generate a lot of heat, but the entire inner workings of a computer get hot, and this
                affects performance and could potentially damange the delicate parts inside. The solution?
                Cooling, of course. While CPU's and GPU's typically have their own cooling facilities, 
                fans will generally be used to cycle fresh air in and through the PC to help keep the 
                inside as cool as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find out more about your PC's cooling system, you'll have to either access a detailed specs sheet for your computer or open up the tower yourself and examine.

                    <p>
                        Typically used on CPU's, although most modern gaming rigs have liquid cooling for the CPU as well.

                    <p>
                        Most PC's have some sort of fan system to cycle air through the inner workings and 
                        over the parts, thus taking with them some of the heat generated through computing. 
                        More advanced PC's, such as those used for gaming, will contain 6 or more fans, whereras 
                        standard PC's will often only have one or two.

                    Liquid Cooling
                    <p>
                        Primarily used for gaming PC's (and some servers and quantum computers) these systems 
                        have hoses that flow through the PC and over heat-generating parts specifically, and 
                        run fluid through the hose/tube system while cycling through a cooler. This is much 
                        how any liquid cooled engine or radiator would run.
