    Mariano Rivera is a Panamanian baseball player, currently retired, that played his entire professional career with the New York Yankees from 1995 to 2013. During this time he accrued more saves than any other pitcher in history (652), was voted to the AL All-star team 13 times, and won 5 World Series championships. The right hander was known not only as a dominant closer, but as a unique pitcher due to the fact that unlike most pitchers he didn't have 3-5 pitches that he alternated - he instead threw only one pitch, his "cutter," a fastball with a very late break, and with pinpoint accuracy he was able to put up these impressive career numbers while keeping a 2.21 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP. Due to Mariano's dominance for nearly two decades with the same club, the Yankees organization decided in 2014 to retire his number (42) out of respect for the former closer.
